            <h2>What is the first thing you think about when someone says they're from Brazil?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>I'm going to guess: soccer, carnaval, and... beaches? Well, I don't know if that was what you thought
                    about, but those are the most famous stereotypes  I've heard from people from other countries about
                    Brazil.
                    <br>
                    As a Brazilian, I must say that that's not even wrong. We had great soccer players like Pelé,
                    Ronaldinho Gaúcho, and Ronaldo Fenômeno. Nowadays, people talk a lot about Neymar ~super overrated in
                    my opinion~ who quickly got famous for having the Brazilian way of dribbling rhythmically and making his
                    professional debut at only 17 years old.<br>
                    Carnaval is a really big celebration and several people put a lot of effort into creating themes 
                    every year to guide their whole parade. Everything needs to be connected, they create songs called 
                    "enredos" and those songs need to talk about the theme they chose, all the costumes and the cars they
                    use during the parade needs to follow the same idea. The themes are usually something relevant that is
                    happening or has happened in Brazil or in the world. They explore themes like history, culture and 
                    social issues.<br>
                    Oh and there's also the beaches... and do I agree with that being something to think about when Brazil
                    is mentioned? YES! I love the beaches. I'm speaking on a point of view of a person who hasn't even visited
                    20% of the main beaches in Brasil, but the ones I've been to and specifically the ones in my region, Northeast...
                    I can assure you, we do have amazing beaches.<br>
                    Are we talking about looks? Yes! They're stunning, <i>but</i>...<br>
                    Going to the beach in Brasil is always a fun and crazy experience.<br>
                    Urban beaches usually have restaurants that will serve you while you're relaxing in front of the sea,
                    under the shade and chairs that they usually provide. Another option is renting a beach umbrella or 
                    bringing your own. Another good idea would be to bring your own food as well, however, there's always 
                    people walking around selling all you can think about:
                    bbq, sea food, drinks, popsicles, ice cream, towels, bathing suits, sunscream, stews, sunglasses,
                    handcrafted earings, necklesses, rings, and so much more.
