                <p>João Pessoa (JP) is the capital of the state Paraíba and it's in the easternmost point of Brazil, that way, it gets the first rays of sunlight on the continent.
                    Pictures one to four are urban beaches in JP, the last two are actually in neighbor cities. Tabatinga beach is located in
                    Conde, a city full of secluted beaches to explore and Jacare beach is in Cabedelo, very famous for its nightly sunset tradition, 
                    in which the saxophonist called Jurandy do Sax plays Ravel's "Bolero" from a boat on the Paraíba River as the sun sets.
